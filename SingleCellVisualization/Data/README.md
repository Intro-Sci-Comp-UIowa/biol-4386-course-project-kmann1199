Files are available through IHG website specifically for Sydney. I also have both the raw data files and already processed data files, both of which are too large for the repository, they are being stored on the Houston lab server.
The finalized gene matrices have also been created and are being stored on the Houston lab server in a folder specifically for SPRING visualization
